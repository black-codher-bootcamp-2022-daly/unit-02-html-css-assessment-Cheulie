        <br>
        I'm a scientist with ambitions of merging my regulatory affairs knowledge with my
        new
        found
        love of coding, web develpment and data science. Ideally I would love to get into med tech especially
        companion devices, however I am presently quite far down the <em>rabbit hole</em> and learning enjoying
        learning so many different things.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my spare time I love learning, travelling, watching movies (do netflix binges count as a hobby?) and crochet.
        Crochet was my hidden super power until I recently read "Invisible women", you should check it out. Maybe you
        will start to crochet too!

        <h2> Journey to coding</h2>

        <div>
            <p><strong>2006 </strong> After successfully passing the Pharmacist Pre registration examination I worked as
                a Locum to broaden my
                experience and as a Pharmacy manager in a busy health centre based pharmacy, conducting MUR's, managing
                a
                nursing homes medication, training two staff to level three dispensing technician</p>
            <p><strong>2007</strong> Joined the MHRA as a Pharmaceutical assessor, responsible for assessing the quality
                of medicinal products and devices on the UK market and variations to such licences. I am also an
                internal auditor.</p>
            <p><strong>2008</strong> Joined the senior leadership team at a local primary school to broaden my skill
                base and gain some management skills. Regulatory affairs is extremely specialised.</p>
            <p><strong>2021</strong> Added Covid vaccinator to my list of skills, trying to do my bit for society and
                widen the scope of my skill base even more.</p>
            <p><strong>2022</strong> After a very traumatic restructuring exercise at work I decided I need to not be so
                stagnant and upskill. I am learning to code via the <a href="https://blackcodher.com" target=""
                    blank">BlackCodher Bootcamp</a>, on completion I will be lucky
                enough to call myself a full stack developer!</p>
            <p><strong>The future... is bright</strong> More coding, more languages, more projects, more learning!</p>
